# Keplers-Problem-Equation

The code in this repository solve's the famous Kepler Problem (Equation) from astrodynamics in MATLAB and Python. 
There is a MATLAB script with symbolic code for further analysis. See Vallado for a discussion on the plot results.

MATLAB Instructions:
1) Download the MATLAB files and choose the TLE data that you need and input the values in the Kepler Main file.
2) Ensure your central body is the Earth, otherwise you need to change the Gravitational Parameter.
3) Run the script.

Python Instructions:
1) Download Keplers_Problem.py and choose the TLE data that you need and input the values in the file.
2) Ensure your central body is the Earth, otherwise you need to change the Gravitational Parameter.
3) Run the script.
